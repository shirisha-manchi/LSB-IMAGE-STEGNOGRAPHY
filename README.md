# 🔐 Image Steganography using C (LSB Technique)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements **Image Steganography** using the **Least Significant Bit (LSB)** technique in **C programming language**.  
It allows users to **hide a secret text file inside a BMP image** (Encoding) and later **extract the hidden message** from the image (Decoding).

The project works at a **low-level binary format**, modifying only the least significant bits of image data, ensuring that the **visual quality of the image remains unchanged**.

## ✨ Features
- Encode secret text into a **24-bit BMP image**
- Decode hidden text from the stego image
- Uses **LSB (Least Significant Bit)** technique
- No visible change in image quality
- Command-line based application
- Supports custom output file names
- Proper error handling and validation

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** C  
- **Concepts Used:**
  - File handling
  - Bitwise operations
  - Structures and pointers
  - Modular programming

## ⚙️ Compilation
Compile the project using `gcc`:

```bash
gcc *.c -o stego

🔸 Encoding (Hide Secret Data)
./stego -e <source.bmp> <secret.txt> [output.bmp]

🔸 Decoding (Extract Secret Data)
./stego -d <stego.bmp> [output.txt]

📤 Output

Encoded BMP image containing hidden data

Decoded text file with the original secret message

Future Enhancements

Support for additional image formats (PNG, JPG)

Password-protected encoding and decoding

GUI-based application

Support for larger file types
